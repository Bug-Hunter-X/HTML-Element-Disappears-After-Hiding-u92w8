# Uncommon HTML Bug: Disappearing Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML where an element, after being hidden using JavaScript, cannot be shown again because it's not properly managed in the DOM.  The issue is not immediately apparent because it involves missing a crucial step in the DOM manipulation process.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page with a div and a button. Clicking the button hides the div. The problem is that there's no code to make the div visible again. Once hidden, there's no way to restore its visibility. This is a common error when developers forget to reset the display style to its original state.

## The Solution

The `solution.html` file shows how to solve this bug.  It includes additional logic in the `myFunction` to handle the state of the div. By adding a check for visibility, it ensures that the div can be hidden and shown repeatedly. 

This showcases the importance of comprehensive DOM manipulation to manage elements effectively.
